This solution is a class homework activity for UT coding bootcamp.

It emulates the game hangman and allows up to 10 wrong guesses (forgiving, I know). The word bank is SCUBA themed, which happens to be a hobby of mine, and provides nice long sciency words. 

mixes html, some custom baked css for slight pushing right around the image at desktop and has some auto scaling things using vw (viewport-width), then the meat of the compare and the update displays is all 'plain vanilla' javascript.
